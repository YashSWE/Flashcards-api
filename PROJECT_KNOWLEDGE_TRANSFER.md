# Flashcards AI Project Knowledge Transfer

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered flashcard generator for language learning and study, built with a decoupled architecture:

Users can generate smart flashcards for Anki by specifying a topic, card template, and custom instructions. The system uses an LLM to generate content-rich cards, which can be exported for use in Anki.


## Use Case
  - Customizable card templates (2, 3, or 4 fields)
  - AI-generated content based on user topic and instructions
  - Downloadable in Anki-compatible format
  - Modern, responsive UI
  - Decoupled backend for scalability and security
